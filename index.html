            <h2>Pitfalls to Avoid</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Neglecting Soil Health:</strong> Failing to improve soil quality can lead to poor plant growth and disappointment.</li>
                <li><strong>Overwatering:</strong> Too much water suffocates plant roots and encourages diseases like root rot.</li>
                <li><strong>Ignoring Plant Needs:</strong> Each plant has specific requirements. Planting incompatible species together can lead to poor growth or disease spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Skipping Pest Prevention:</strong> Ignoring pests can lead to infestations that damage or destroy your plants.</li>
                <li><strong>Over-fertilization:</strong> Excessive fertilization harms plants and contaminates water sources.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting Invasive Species:</strong> Non-native invasive plants can overtake your garden and harm local ecosystems.</li>
                <li><strong>Improper Pruning:</strong> Incorrect pruning can weaken plants or alter their natural shape.</li>
                <li><strong>Ignoring Climate:</strong> Planting plants unsuited to your climate leads to disappointment and extra work.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting Too Deep:</strong> Planting too deeply can suffocate roots and impede growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Rushing Planting Season:</strong> Planting too early or late exposes plants to unfavorable weather conditions.</li>
            </ul>
